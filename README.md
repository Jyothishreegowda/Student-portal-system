# Student-portal-system

A student portal project that acts as an online portal between students and the admin. The system
is designed for a particular branch for CSE, where students can view resources like notes, sample
question papers, textbooks, etc. On the Student Portal you will find information about studies such
as courses and faculties for each subject.
The main objective of this portal is to provide a single place to students from where they can get
all the study related activities without login to different websites. In other words, to provide a
single place for all kind of jobs.
